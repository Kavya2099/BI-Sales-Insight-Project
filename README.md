# Problem statement
AtliQ Hardware, with multiple branches across India, provides computer hardware and peripheral manufacturers to its clients. The sales director is encountering difficulties in comprehending the company's current issues and performance, as sales are decreasing below expectations. 

Whenever the director seeks updates from regional managers regarding sales and the market, they tend to sugarcoat the truth and send excessive Excel files, adding to the director's frustration. The frustration is understandable, as humans often find it challenging to comprehend numbers from Excel files.

# Solution
As a data analyst, a solution to address the sales director's problem at AtliQ hardware would be to BI dahsboards that can help with data visualization and analysis. The sales director can use dashboard that pulls in data from various sources, including the company's sales data, market trends, and regional manager reports. With the dashboard, the sales director can easily see the current state of the business, identify problem areas, and make data-driven decisions.
